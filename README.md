# CS255

The DrivePass project I worked on throughout this course was about creating a comprehensive system to manage user regidtrations, schedule driving lessions, book driving tests, and track student progress. The goal was to create an intuitive ans efficient platform that would simplify these processes for both students and administrators. The Client DriverPass was owner by someone named Liam. What I did wenn throughout the project was focusued on user experience and requirments requested by the owners. Continuously documenting and claifying with the client to make sure we captured thie entire vision of the platform. If I coulw revise one part of my work it owuld be the UML diagrams I created in the last few weeks. I believe if I had set aside a little bit extra time to work on the diagrams they would've came out as I was execting them to. I enterpreted the users needs by helping to create a system that allows them to convinently book, cancel, or modify any appointments and study for their driving test on a mobile device or computer. It's important to impleent user needs into designing because they will be the ones providing most of the feedback and letting the team know what needs improvment. When desiginign a software, I would start eith thorough requirments gathering and analysis. I would use techniques such as user interviews, surveys, and workshops to understand the needs and expectations.
